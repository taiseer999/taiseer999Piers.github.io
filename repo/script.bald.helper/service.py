"""Bald Helper service: Bald's keymaps (resources/lib/keymap.py), its blurred backgrounds (resources/lib/blur.py),
its latency-sensitive skin actions (resources/lib/actions.py), its online ratings (resources/lib/ratings.py), its
spoiler stills (resources/lib/spoilers.py), its typeface and text size (resources/lib/lookandfeel.py) its
tidied weather values and weather tiles' pictures (resources/lib/weather.py), the focused item's time left
(resources/lib/remaining.py) and the art pre-cache (resources/lib/precache.py), which gets the fanart Bald shows next
into Kodi's texture cache so remote backdrops do not arrive late.

The blur follower, the ratings follower, the action worker and the art pre-cache run on their own threads; the keymap manager runs here,
on the thread whose monitor receives the skin's notifications (and whose player receives playback events), and keeps
working if any of the others cannot start.
