"""Bald Helper's blurred backdrops: follow the item Bald's background shows, blur its fanart and publish the file.

Which item that is comes from follow.py, shared with the ratings follower: the container the skin names in the
Bald.FocusContainer property of the active window (or of the information dialog while it is open), else the focused
item of a media window (Container.ListItem) or the information dialog's own item (ListItem). Its fanart, else
the show's fanart, else its thumb, is cut to 480 x 270, blurred and written once to this add-on's cache; the path goes
to Home's window properties:

    Bald.Blur       the current blurred file; empty for an item without art or where there is nothing to follow
    Bald.Blur.Last  the last non-empty Bald.Blur (for windows without an item of their own)
    Bald.Blur.For   the source image Bald.Blur was made from; written last

It works only while Bald is the skin and its blur is on, and rests during fullscreen video and the screensaver.
A source whose blur is already cached is published once it has stayed the same for FAST_SETTLE_SECONDS, even while
its container scrolls (switching to a known image costs one file check). Anything else waits until the source has
stayed the same for SETTLE_SECONDS and its container is not scrolling, so fast scrolling makes no work; it is then
blurred on one worker thread and published only if it is still the current source. Pillow (script.module.pil) is imported only when first needed; without it nothing is
published and the skin keeps its plain field.

Written from Pillow's documentation and Kodi's Python API. Nothing here imports xbmc at module level, so the tests
drive it with stand-ins.
